# Background information

Need to develop a console application to manage a library of books. The application should allow adding, deleting, searching and displaying books using only standard python 3 libraries

## Project opening

Clone the project

```bash
https://github.com/VizingBear/task_manager.git
```

Open project directory and start the application
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
When authorizing, use 
```python
login:admin
password:admin
```
Use the console and the appropriate keys to manage the project. Simply press the desired number when a number is required or text when no number is required. The main menu looks like this
```python
Add task(1), Delete task(2), Search task(3), Change task status(4), Exit(0)
```
The database will be created automatically
